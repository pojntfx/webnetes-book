# Go Networking (tinynet)

To support networking in Go and TinyGo, you can either use [unisockets](./unisockets.md) directly, or preferably tinynet, a `net` implementation for Go and TinyGo based on unisockets. Consult the [tinynet Documentation](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/tinynet) for more information.
