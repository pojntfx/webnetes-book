# Develop

Getting started developing for Webnetes is simple and not much harder than native development; migrating existing apps is also possible. In most cases, the only difference from a Webnetes-enabled project to a native-only project is the additional WebAssembly target.

We have guides for a many popular, officially supported languages like Go and Rust to get you started quickly. If your language doesn't have such a guide yet, you can probably still get it to work; see [More](./more.md).
