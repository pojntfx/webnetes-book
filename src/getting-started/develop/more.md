Webnetes can, in addition to the languages documented before, also run any further languages supported by the runtimes as [documented in Compute](../../architecture/compute.md). Even if your language doesn't support any of the ones specified there, adding support for another one is easy (just add your own handler to the [virtual machine](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/webnetes/blob/main/lib/controllers/virtual-machine.ts#L12-L18)). If you wish to have another runtime officially supported, please open a new issue in the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/alphahorizonio/webnetes/issues) and we'll look into it.
