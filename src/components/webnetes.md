# Node (webnetes)

The node is the embeddable version of Webnetes. It exposes the [four base systems](../architecture) with an easy-to-use API and is used to power the [app](./webnetes.md). Using basic knowledge of JavaScript or TypeScript, it can be effortlessly embedded in any Node or web app if you wish to use any of Webnetes' features.

For more information, see the [embedding API](../reference/embedding-api.md).
