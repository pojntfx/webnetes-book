# App (webnetesctl)

## Introduction

To interact with the [node](./webnetes.md), an app is used. It provides an easy-to-use interface to develop, distribute and operate apps on Webnetes. It should be noted that while webnetesctl is the primary app, you can also choose to use an alternative for a more lightweight experience or even build your own app without too much effort.
