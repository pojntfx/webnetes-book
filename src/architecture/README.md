# Architecture

Webnetes is made up of four high-level, independent systems: a [compute system](./compute.md), a [networking system](./networking.md), a [storage system](./storage.md) and finally a [management system](./management.md), which, once combined, form a [Webnetes node](../components/webnetes.md).

While the following is not exhaustive documentation, it should give you a quick overview of the systems; for a deeper understanding, please consult the linked source code documentation.
